# Shortcuts Code Examples

This repository contains code examples to assist
developers with the use of Shortcuts APIs. Each 
folder is an independent and self-contained example.

You can clone or fork this entire repository. Most examples
will work out of the box with Shortcuts Demo sites. If you 
want to run the examples against your own data then you will
need to obtain API Access Keys for your site(s).

Usually we find that this is a good starting point for API
users to try out and verify general code and processes.
When you get to the point where you need to implement
your own custom code and processes, that require your 
own data and business rule setup, then we recommend
that you start using the APIs with your own Access Keys.

## The examples fall into three categories:  

### API

#### [Java API Example](./api/java/)

An end-to-end example of using the shortcuts API.

#### [API Javascript Sample](./legacy/api-js-sample/)

Online Services. Intended for implementors of single signon.
